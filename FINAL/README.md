INFO-616: FINAL PROJECT — When the Median is not the Message
==============================================================

--------------------------------

The attached visualizations were created for my INFO-616, Programming Interactive Visualization, final project. I worked with data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) — from their Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE). My post and project explore both income inequality and the limitations of the median.
