The attached visualization was created as an assignment for INFO-616, Programming Interactive Visualization.
Data source for historical college tuition prices is: https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d20/tables/dt20_330.10.asp. I created five CSVs, each with yearly college tution costs by decade, starting in the 1970 and going through 2018. All costs are adjusted for inflation.  The user can click on buttons to update the bar chart with the data from a specific decade.
