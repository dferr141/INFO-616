Week 5 Assignment: Thoughtful Color Usage
==========================================

Diane Ferrera, INFO-616
-----------------------

The attached visualization was created as an assignment for INFO-616, Programming Interactive Visualization.
I gathered the data from this book: Red Wine: The Comprehensive Guide to the 50 Essential Varieties & Styles, by 
Kevin Zraly. I generated a CSV based on the book's wine descriptions and created a color scale to match actual coloring of each wine variety.  The wine glass SVG is from Noun Project; https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=753678&i=753678.
