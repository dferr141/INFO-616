Week 9 Assignment: Network Analysis
============================================================

Diane Ferrera, INFO-616
-----------------------

The attached visualization was created as an assignment for INFO-616, Programming Interactive Visualization. I created my own dataset - in an attempt to better understand the data that comprises network analysis. The nodes represent friends.  The size of the node is determined by the length of years I have known each friend. Friends that know one another are cnonnected - the length of those friendships represented by the width of the link line. The user can drag the network analysis graphic. There is also a rollover tooltip providing the name and my lenght of the friendship.  Ideally the legend would interact with the graphic (click on a legend name and highligh where that node is in the network) - but I did make it that far this week.
