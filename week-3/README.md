Week 3 Assignment: Scatterplot and Bar Chart with Scales and Axes
==========================================

Diane Ferrera, INFO-616
-----------------------

The attached visualizations were created as assignments for INFO-616, Programming Interactive Visualization.
The scatterplot displays a week of text messages - both received and sent.
The bar chart displays a daily breakdown of text messages sent.
Both data sets were created and imported as CSVs.
