Week 8 Assignment: Pie / Stacked Bar / Stacked Area Charts
============================================================

Diane Ferrera, INFO-616
-----------------------

The attached visualizations were created as an assignment for INFO-616, Programming Interactive Visualization. I created my own data for this assignment - based on how I spend the hours in a day.  The doughnut chart displays the breakdown of hours in a given week, into six categories.  The stacked bar chart displays the breakdown of hours for each day of the week.  The stacked area chart uses the date on the x-axis and number of hours on the y-axis.
