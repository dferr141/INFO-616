Week 4 Assignment: Bespoke SVG
==========================================

Diane Ferrera, INFO-616
-----------------------

The attached visualizations were created as assignments for INFO-616, Programming Interactive Visualization.
I generated the SVG bird in JavaScript.  I then attached data to the bird, to display bird counts using a color scale.
