Week 4 Assignment: Bespoke SVG
==========================================

Diane Ferrera, INFO-616
-----------------------

The attached visualizations were created as assignments for INFO-616, Programming Interactive Visualization.
I generated the SVG bird in JavaScript.  I then attempted to append data to the bird, this venture was less sucessful, as I could not get the bird shape to render properly within the rest of my code.
